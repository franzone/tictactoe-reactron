# X/O TicTacToe ReacTron
This is a project I am using to learn both Electron and React at the same time. It's the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial within an Electron project.

## React
The React framework is a Javascript library used to create web applications.

## Electron
Electron is a set of libraries for building cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Tutorial
I will be following along with the tutorial located here : https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

I plan on creating releases for each of the steps along the tutorial, for anyone who may be interested in seeing a snapshot in time of my process.

## Author
My name is Jonathan Franzone and I blog at https://tech.franzone.blog (and other places).
